Attempting to write simple twitterAPi consumer for interview purposes and also for learning Angular with no previous experience with that framework.

The application provides access to the custom twitter API with possibilities to fetch tweets by #hashtag and username.

The App is responsive(you can drag your browser window or open devtools and switch to mobile view) and covered with tests

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
